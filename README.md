# The Icebreakers Homepage HTML

## Objectives

1. Create a complete page of well-structured HTML!

## Instructions

Open `index.html` in your text editor. You'll see the code that we wrote in the previous lab. In this lab, you're tasked with fleshing out the `body` of the HTML document with some awesome content, completing the static homepage we've been working on as a template for our forthcoming Icebreakers app.

Inside the `body` tags and below the `header` section, create a new `main` section that will house all of the primary content for our homepage. Within the new `main` tags, nest a pair of `div` elements. The first `div` element should contain an `h1` with some text you'd like to use as the main heading on the page. Below the `h1`, add a `p`(aragraph) element with some text describing the site. For all of these content elements you're adding, the content doesn't matter. Be creative! The tests will only be checking that the correct elements exist in the correct places.

The second `div` element should contain two `h4` elements with each one followed by a `p` tag element. Think of this as a "component" for a question, a title followed by a description. The `p` elements should each contain a single `a` element with an `href` that points to `#` (which we're using as a placeholder since we haven't yet created any other pages that we'd want our links to point at).

Finally, beneath the closing `main` tag but still within the `body`, create a `footer` element that contains a `p` element.

You can run the tests with this lab via `learn`. Make sure you save the file before running the test suite. Failing tests will provide helpful error messages that you can use to debug your code — read them closely for hints!

## Viewing your work in the browser

While working through these assignments, your general workflow should center on writing code in the text editor and periodically running the test suite in the terminal to check your work.

Another great way to track your progress is to open up the HTML document in your browser and watch how each change you make in the text editor affects the visual layout in the browser. If you're using a local development environment, you can open the HTML file directly in your browser. If you're coding in the Learn IDE, check out this [Help Center article](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/common-ide-questions/viewing-html-pages-in-the-learn-ide) that explains how to spin up and connect to a simple remote server.

Once you have the HTML document open in your browser, you can make changes to it in the text editor, save the file, refresh the page in the browser, and see the changes instantly.
